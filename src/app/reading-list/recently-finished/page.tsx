            I decided to read this after encountering a few excerpts like the
            following:
            <br />
            <br />
            <i>
              There was a red-haired man who had no eyes or ears. Neither did he
              have any hair, so he was called red-haired theoretically. He
              couldn&apos;t speak, since he didn&apos;t have a mouth. Neither
              did he have a nose. He didn&apos;t even have any arms or legs. He
              had no stomach and he had no back and he had no spine and he had
              no innards whatsoever. He had nothing at all! Therefore
              there&apos;s no knowing whom we are even talking about. In fact
              it&apos;s better that we don&apos;t say any more about him.
            </i>
            <br />
            <br />A fan of Carroll and Lear and nonsense more generally, I
            thought this would be right up my alley. However, it did not{" "}
            <i>quite</i> scratch the itch I expected, and I have mixed feelings
            overall. You know those half-crazed sleep-deprived late-night
            thoughts that you frantically scramble to write down (&quot;This is
            important!&quot; or &quot;Hahaha oh man I don&apos;t want to forget
            this!&quot;) but mystify you upon a morning re-read? This was, for
            better and worse, my experience with reading Kharms. (My favorite
            sketch was &quot;How I Was Visited By Messengers&quot;, which felt
            like it transported me into a bizarre alternative pyschology.) Words
            like &quot;Kafkaesque,&quot; &quot;

            I have been reading the four Classic Chinese Novels (in
            translation). This is perhaps the zaniest of the four: after a
            prelude introducing Sun Wukong and then Tripitaka, it enters into a
            series of episodes involving demons and Buddhist/Daoist magic as the
            protagonists make their way to the Thunderclap Monastery in the
            West. As well as any other, this novel embodies Bakhtin&apos;s
            chronotope of the road. While fun, the umpteenth time Tripitaka (and
            sometimes friends) is captured or else in danger of capture and
            relying on the wiles of Pilgrim Sun and sometimes the power of other
            Celestials to save him which often involve the poetic narration of
            battles cast in the same poetic narration as all those previous
            battles (one is reminded of the similarly indistinguishable
            skirmishes in chivalric romance of &quot;passing fair knights&quot;
            who fight for hours or the ironically mundane &quot;it was even{" "}
            <i>more</i> more beautiful than before&quot; passages in
            Dante&apos;s <i>Paradiso</i>) that often describe magic artifacts
            and histories you have read several times already while ... can
            become tedious, even if there are (apparently--here I trust Wu and
            his endnotes) allegorical meanings underpinning much of the text.

        >
          <p>
            Debord&apos;s main aim is to extend Marx&apos;s concept of the
            alienation of labor: we are alienated from reality itself, he
            argues, because capitalism finds its highest (lowest?) expression in
            serving us a self-perpetuating system of fragmented images. We
            interact not with reality, and not with each other, because our
            experiences and social lives are mediated through images. In some
            ways prescient, in some ways questionable (how much have our lives{" "}
            <i>always</i> been shaped by &quot;images&quot;, like parables,
            anecdotes, tall tales?), it is regardless an interesting read. There
            is a certain poetics of absence that characterizes a good deal of
            French--and Marxist--philosophy and critical theory. (I am thinking
            of the empty signifiers or <i>objet petit a</i> in Lacan, the{" "}
            <i>différance</i> and erasure of Derrida, the shiftiness of an
            &quot;author&quot; in Foucault, the death of the author of Barthes,
            the simulacra of Baudrillard, etc.) Debord, I think, fits in this
            sometimes profound, sometimes infuriating tradition.

            What a trip! Hilariously surreal, this book was not quite like
            anything I have read before. A great mixture of transcontinental
            adventure (as it were), occultic magic, existential mystery, and
            drama as we follow 92-year-old Marian on her journey of
            self-discovery and/or self-destruction. The cozily apocalyptic
            ending was, on the whole, unsatisfying given the utter craziness of
            the rest of the book, but that utter craziness more than makes up
            for it. Also, props to Carrington for writing a solid, original
            riddle:

            I lack the background to fully appreciate the learnedness or the
            blending of the zhiguai (Weird Account) and chuanqi (Strange Story)
            genres, but this selection of Pu Songling&apos;s tales is
            entertaining and contains a few little gems. (Although unlikely to
            be among the more popular tales, &quot;The Little Mandarin&quot; is
            my favorite because of its charmingly understated and unresolved
            bizarreness.) Somewhat distracting is the panoply of sexy female
            ghosts and fox spirits visiting lonely sexless men that brings to
            mind terms like &quot;scopophilia&quot; and &quot;male gaze&quot;
            and &quot;l&apos;écriture féminine&quot; etc.

            An enjoyable light read. The relevance of the chosen computer
            science concepts to everyday life is often overly simplistic and
            sometimes contrived (&quot;relaxation&quot;, for instance,
            precariously balanced on multiple senses of the word), but casting
            daily decisions in terms of optimal stopping, the explore/exploit
            tradeoff, and cacheing strategies is at the very least entertaining
            and sometimes maybe even helpful. I also appreciated being exposed
            to the multi-armed bandit problem and Gitten index, which were
            unfamiliar to me before.

            Like Nabokov, Calvino, or Woolf, Milorad Pavić is a <i>writer</i>.
            Not everything he says is golden--indeed, there is at times a
            certain Mannerist tendency in his phrasing that verges on
            nonsense--but his writing is always sensuous, flirtatious, as if
            there is a mystery hiding behind each word. Many of his sentences
            are a delight to read. He is a master of the complement: a focus on
            the shadows, on the binaries, on the negative spaces, etc. Examples:
            &quot;He divided the voices in his mouth into masculine and
            feminine, on Marian holidays he uttered only the vowels and on other
            holidays only the consonants&quot; (26); &quot;Or they [the monks]
            would utter only nouns, because these come from God, and would avoid
            verbs, which belong to Satan&quot; (73). Do I understand the whole
            novel? No, although I am not sure how much of it is meant to be
            understood. <i>Landscape Painted with Tea</i> is like a great dream:
            pregnant with undifferentiated meaning (a sort of{" "}

            ), full of brilliant images and thoughtful scenarios, a paeon to the
            the way that rhetoric grapples with and structures reality (through
            paradox, antithesis, etc.). Pavić offers two different ways to read
            the novel: in &quot;page-order,&quot; or in &quot;crossword&quot;
            order. Here are two more: One can dive in and certainly find
            something worth treasuring within its depths, but one can just as
            well let the novel wash over them, smiling.

            Like everything he writes, the prose is thoughtful, playful, and
            beautiful. The tale exists in, or is composed of, a lyrical
            metafictional mist: this piece perhaps interacting with that, this
            comment a recollection of a quote from two chapters before, etc. It
            doesn&apos;t contain the revelation that is sometimes enjoyable in a
            mystery--unlike (say) &quot;The Vane Sisters&quot; but like much of
            his paranoia-infused work, it actively thwarts such revelation--but
            the final &quot;twist&quot; (he is in the wrong hospital room, just
            as Sebastian visited the wrong room when trying to trace out his
            mother&apos;s final days) is clever, in its way, if somewhat
            predictable. I think the most compelling interpretation is that this
            is about the process of writing, connecting, narrativizing our
            lives--a vivisection of the author at play. Not a masterpiece, but
            written by a master.

            A brilliant book, and one of my new favorites. Written with verve
            and erudition, simultaneously silly and profound. It is difficult
            for me to mark &quot;highlights&quot; as I found something of
            interest in every story. However, the &quot;logical&quot; world of
            Marcel Coscat&apos;s Robinson being torn apart by none other than
            Robinson himself, the paranoic interconnectedness in
            &quot;Gigamesh,&quot; the hilarious audacity of a German Nazi cohort
            trying to re-create 18th-century France in inner Argentina in
            &quot;Gruppenfürher Louis XVI,&quot; the bizarre meditations on the
            different levels of genius in &quot;Odysseus of Ithaca,&quot; the
            humbling suggestion that all of culture is clothing that transforms
            (in the realm of ideas) the awfulness of life (sickness, old age,
            death) into virtue (experience, wisdom, dying for an ideal) for
            evolutionary reasons in &quot;Die Kultur als Fehler,&quot; the
            radical assessment of the interminable series of chance events in
            &quot;Being Inc.&quot; and &quot;De Impossibilitate Vitae and De
            Impossibilitate Prognoscendi,&quot; the dialogues of personoids who
            subsist in the mathematics provided by computers in &quot;Non
            Serviam,&quot; the idea that the universe is full of agents who
            designed the rules of nature (which are changing) and thus the
            absence of communication is in itself a signal in &quot;The New
            Cosmogony&quot;--what a blast. Themes include the blurring of real
            and artificial, the aggregation of chance, writing and reading,
            thought and reality, consciousness, representation.

            A good, humorous (but seriously philosophical) book that takes up
            Wittgenstein&apos;s challenge to define a game. The central thesis,
            which is playfully expounded and defended in dialogic fashion
            (sometimes even with nested and metaleptic dialogues), is that a
            game 1) involves a prelusory goal (a way of framing the goal of the
            game outside of the game itself, even if--like chess--using the
            terminology of the game is a useful expedient), 2) sought only via
            lusory means that 3) are constrained by constitutive rules that
            permit only less efficient ways of obtaining the goal, all
            undertaken via 4) a lusory attitude--accepting the rules because the
            enable the activity. A convincing thesis, even if later meditations
            on Utopia are questionable.

            Like a more Kafka-esque, slightly longer-form Borges. In general, he
            seems to have some great ideas and brilliant phrasing, but mixed
            overall execution. E.g., &quot;The Collector of Cracks&quot; is held
            back by its more metatextual, &quot;framing&quot; element; the
            interdiegetic parable itself, however, is ingenious. I enjoyed the
            stories a great deal, but overall I felt that something was missing.

            I have been reading the four Classic Chinese Novels (in
            translation). After <i>Water Margin</i> and{" "}
            <i>The Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i>,{" "}
            <i>The Story of the Stone</i> is a marked change of pace. The novel
            is slower and more meditative, not terribly unlike{" "}
            <i>À la recherche du temps perdu</i>, both in terms of theme as well
            as narrative style. On the one hand, I missed the military/poltical
            shenanigans of characters like Wu Yong and (especially) Zhuge Liang;
            on the other, I appreciated the psychological depth and literariness
            of this later novel. Xuequin (among others?) narrativizes time as
            well as Tolstoy or Proust, and his rich portrayals of character
            render moments that might otherwise reek of bathos (e.g., the
            &quot;resolution&quot; of the love triangle between Bao Yu, Lin
            Daiyu, and Bao Chai) powerful and affecting. This is the sort of
            novel that reminds the reader what even the best short story cannot
            do: in the final pages, one cannot help but remember, dream-like,
            the full history of the tale and the consequent weight of its
            ending.

          In the introduction, Jacques Voisine writes, &quot;Dans ce dernier
          chef-d&apos;œuvre brûle le farouche orgueil du Rousseau de toujours,
          hanté par la crainte qu&apos;on puisse confondre avec le reste des
          hommes&quot; (&quot;In this last masterpiece, as always, burns the
          fierce pride of Rousseau, haunted by the fear that one might confuse
          him with the rest of mankind&quot;). This is spot on. Rousseau is a
          fantastic writer--I think his masterful use of parallelism and
          antithesis has something to do with it--but reading him now, I
          can&apos;t help but notice how overbearing he must have been!
          Everywhere he takes pains to note just how exceptional he is--in
          suffering, in honesty, in humility, in serenity. It reminds me a bit
          of Cicero, but whinier. [More thoughts to come.]

            highly enlightening as it clarified several ideas I had only thought
            through halfway. For instance: A great many tensions--sense vs.
            nonsense, biologically fit vs. not, &quot;good A.I.&quot; vs.
            &quot;dangerous A.I.&quot;--can be thought of as alignment problems,
            i.e., aligning one system so that it &quot;fits nicely&quot; with
            another. Of course, as Adami explains (in a biological context which
            I recklessly generalize!), these alignment problems are
            &quot;really&quot; about mutual information. This leads to a whole
            series of fascinating questions: If information is contextual
            (information is only information <i>about</i> something), then what
            about that old bugbear of philosophers, &quot;Truth?&quot; If
            meaning/fitness/etc. is a dynamic relationship between object and
            environment, how might the two mutually shape (or diverge from) each
            other? I decided to read the book. [More thoughts to come.]

            I wanted to get a better sense of programming language design. The
            most interesting and/or helpful information for me has been about
            variable binding, scopes, and extents (e.g., why closures lead to
            semi-infinite binding extents, and what lexical vs. dynamic scoping
            entails); implicit vs. explicit referencing and eager vs. lazy
            parameter passing (e.g., why lazy parameter passing works well in
            functional languages but not in stateful languages); control
            contexts and continuations (e.g., what exactly tail-call
            optimizations and trampolining are).

            A delightful collection of essays on recursion, reflexivity, music,
            A.I., and other mathemagical topics. I began reading this without
            intending to and found myself a third of the way through. It is
            interesting to compare the ideas about artificial intelligence in
            the 1980s to the recent phase shift with LLMs. I most enjoyed the
            self-reflexive sentences, like this one; the idea of parquet
            deformations; and the game theoretic experiments (e.g., Axelrod). It
            also suggested to me Codex Seraphinianus, a curious piece of
            literature (?).
