        I enjoy playing the piano. I have little formal training, which means my
        sight reading is atrocious and transcribing compositions is slow and
        tedious. However, I enjoy playing by ear and have a few pieces that I
        think are worthwhile.

        I have included any background context along with recordings on the
        individual music project pages. My hope is to upload scores (and maybe
        better recording quality) in the not-too-distant-future.

        EDIT: My hope is to upload <i>something</i>, <i>sometime</i>. Probably
        the D-minor piece.
